In other words, if this feature is turned on, the system will check the status of the TX the current TX depends on. Only if the status says successful, then the current TX will be accepted for processing by the system.\nHere by successful, we mean two things:\nthe TX has been included in the ledger, and\nit has been successfully executed, or not reverted in the blockchain language.\nThe second requirement is particularly important since seeing a TX included in the ledger does not guarantee that it has been successfully executed. A TX can be included, but with a status “Reverted” which means that the system does not actually do what the TX asks it to do. In practice, a TX can be reverted due to the insufficient amount of gas provided by the sender. It can also be reverted by the smart-contract function it calls. For instance, a TX would be reverted by a token-transfer function if the sender did not have a larger enough token balance.\nNote that you can make your TX to depend on any TX as long as you provide its "),n("em",[e._v("TXID")]),e._v(".
